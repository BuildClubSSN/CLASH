# CLASH: Color Line-following & Autonmous Stacking Hunt

<div align="center"><img src="./media/CLASH-logo.png" width="500"></div><br>


## Event Introduction

Welcome to an exciting robotics challenge themed around rescue operations. Participants will design and program autonomous robotsâ€”Rescue Botsâ€”that navigate, detect, and manipulate colored objects to simulate a real-life rescue mission. Success in this challenge requires a perfect blend of robust hardware, intelligent software, and strategic decision-making.

### Core Capabilities

The core functionality for these bots revolves around two key capabilities:

* **Line Following & Color Detection:**
    Robots must follow a predefined line path while detecting colored cubes (red, green, blue) positioned alongside the track. They must accurately count the cubes, interpret track intersections, and make intelligent decisions based on the data they gather.

* **Pick and Place Operations:**
    Based on color detection and counts, the robot will engage in precise pick-and-place tasks, sorting and moving cubes to designated zones.

## Competition Structure

### Phase 1: Qualifier - Basic Navigation & Counting

In this stage, the bot will perform fundamental navigation and sorting tasks on a pre-disclosed map. A rough demo map for phase 1 is given below:

<div align="center"><img src="./resources/rough-track-phase-1.jpeg" width="500"></div><br>

#### Objectives:

1.  **Navigation:** The robot will navigate a black track. Colored cubes (**5x5x5 cm**) will be placed on the **left side** of the line_following track.
2.  **Counting:** As the robot moves, it must maintain a running count of the cubes for each color (Red, Green, Blue).
3.  **Checkpoint Logic:** The track includes **intersections** marked by a fully black strip (equal in width to the track). Upon reaching an intersection, the bot must analyze its current cube count to determine which color has appeared most frequently so far. After analysis, it must return to the start and then pick up the respective box.
4.  **Placement Task:**  After picking, the bot continues along the line where three colored regions are marked on the left side floor and the same color strips are placed opposite to the regions . Using the color sensor, the bot identifies the matching region and places the box in its corresponding location.
5.  **Finish:** Finally, the bot must proceed along the track after placing the box and stop when it detects a stop region, represented as an all-black area of width greater than 25 mm.

> **Note:** The start and stop areas are larger in size than the intersection strips to be easily distinguishable.

### Phase 2: The Final - 24hr Rescue Hackathon

This stage is an on-the-spot hackathon on a new, un-disclosed map, designed to simulate a complex real-world rescue operation.

#### The Mission:

As the robot navigates the path, it must identify and count all colored cubes. The cubes represent different entities:
* ðŸŸ¥ **Red Cubes:** Bomb Hazard â€“ **Must be collected.**
* ðŸŸ¦ **Blue Cubes:** Radioactive Material â€“ **Must be collected.**
* ðŸŸ© **Green Cubes:** Safe Civilians â€“ **Must NOT be collected or disturbed.**

#### Phases of Operation:

1.  **Scanning Run:** The robot must first navigate the entire assigned path to identify and count all colored cubes.
2.  **Collection & Delivery Run:** After the initial scan, the robot must return to the track to collect only the **Red** and **Blue** cubes and deliver them to their respective drop zones.

#### Navigation and Delivery:

* The track may contain loops, intersection, t - junctions, right-angle turns, acute turns, or diode-shaped paths.
* The end of counting is indicated not by an intersection, but by a series of broken black lines on the track.
* For intersections that occur before the broken line region in Phase 2, the bot is hardcoded to **alwaysÂ moveÂ straight**.
* When the **broken lines are detected**, the bot performs a 180Â° turn, returns to the **start zone** (again detected by a black region greater than 25 mm), executes another 180Â° turn, and begins the **pick-and-place task**.
* The track will contain **branching points** (e.g., T-intersections) that require a decision.
* **Left Turn â†’** red region, where the red box (Bomb Hazard) must be placed.
* **Right Turn â†’** blue box (Radioactive Material) must be placed.
* Each drop zone is marked with a **large solid colored area**.
* After placing all the hazardous materials, the robot must **proceed straight** from the final branching point to reach the end zone, also marked with a large black area greater than 25mm width.

## Technical and Design Guidelines


* **Dimensions:** The final robot's base dimensions must not exceed **20 cm x 20 cm**. The height limit is **20 cm** (excluding the dimensions of the robotic arm when fully extended).
* **Weight:** Maximum weight should not be more than __5Kgs__ including battery, however, a tolerance of 5% in weight is acceptable.
* **Cube Specifications:** Cubes are fixed at **5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm**. Cube weights will be announced prior to the event.

* **Component Sourcing:** Participants may source robotic arms, chassis, motors, and sensors externally. However, pre-assembled commercial robot kits are not permitted.
* **Voltage rating:** The electric voltage anywhere in the machine should not be more than 16.8V DC at any point in time for each robot.
* **Autonomy:** All robots must operate **100% autonomously**. No form of remote control, wireless communication, or manual intervention is permitted during a run.

## General Rules & Conduct

* **Attempts:** Each team will get **one official, timed run** for each stage.
* **Calibration:** A short, designated period for sensor calibration on the official track will be provided before the official run begins.
* **Disputes:** The decisions of the event coordinators and judges are final.

## Communication

All official communication, announcements, and queries will be handled through the official **CLASH Discord server**. Please join the server for updates.

> **Important:** Direct messaging (DM) to organizers on personal platforms (e.g., WhatsApp) is strictly restricted. Please use the designated channels on Discord.

## Scoring System (To Be Finalized)

The detailed scoring rubric will be released soon. Expect points to be awarded for:
* Successful completion of tasks (e.g., correct placement).
* Time taken to complete the course.
* Penalties for errors (e.g., placing wrong cubes, going off-track).

## Arena & Track Specifications (To Be Finalized)

* The stage 2 track design will be unveiled during the main competition only.
* The arena containing the track will be of dimension __16x16 Sq.Ft__.
* The width of the black line will be __30mm__.
* The surface of the track will be white with a black line marked on it.
* The track may contain crossed, curved, or discontinuous black lines.

## Design Recommendations and resources 

We can broadly divide our bot into different divisions, and each division will handle a specific functionality.
