# ðŸ§  Microcontroller (MCU)

### Why we require a microcontroller  
- The microcontroller is the **brain of the robot**. Just like the brain processes signals from eyes/ears and tells muscles what to do, the MCU processes sensor data and controls motors/grippers. 
- It processes sensor inputs, applies algorithms (like PID for line following), and sends control signals to actuators.  
- Without the MCU, sensors and actuators would work in isolation with no coordination.  

### A small brief on how it works  
- The MCU reads data from sensors (line sensors, color sensor, proximity sensor, etc.) using its input pins (digital or analog).  
- It executes programmed logic (C/C++ or Arduino code) to make decisions. 
- A microcontroller is programmed using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), the most common IDE is **Arduino IDE**.
- Few sophisticated IDEs are **platform.io** with VS code, **ESP-IDF** and **STM32CUBEIDE** (tailor made for esp and stm respectively). 
- Based on logic, it outputs PWM, direction signals, or digital commands to drivers/servos.  
- It also handles communication (Bluetooth, UART, I2C, SPI) between modules.
- Arduino is an 8-bit MCU whereas ESP and STM are 32-bit (esp32 stm32).  

### Common options  

- **Arduino UNO / Nano (ATmega328P)** â€“ beginner-friendly, cheap, widely used.  
- **ESP32** â€“ dual-core, built-in WiFi/Bluetooth, higher ADC resolution, useful for advanced robots.  
- **STM32 (e.g., STM32F4 series)** â€“ powerful ARM Cortex MCUs, used in more professional robots.
